<h2><b>Tripify:</b></h2>

Our Tripify project is an app that enables the user to provide a 'start location' and 'end location' to get a duration of how long it's going to take to get to their destination. From there, the app pulls that information and lets the user know what events are going on when they arrive at their destination


<b>Getting Started:</b> 

In order to access the app, please visit: https://fakenewz.github.io/tripify/. From here you'll be able to enter in your information and test the app to see all of its great functionalities. We recommend testing out different locations to see what events are listed in what cities but don't try to drive to London because you can't drive across the water, lol...

<b>Prerequisites: </b>

The app is available on all browsers and fully functional. 
If you're using Google Chrome, please download “Allow-Control-Allow-Origin” to fully access all the functionalities of the app. 
Allow-Control-Allow-Origin location:

<b>Installing: </b>

No installation required


<b>Running the tests: </b>

The app works as follows:
The user enters in a starting location; when the user enters a starting location, the input field will begin to give the user an auto-fill option of locations that begin with the letters that the user inputs. This option gives the user flexibility and convenience to access their information quicker and without committing an error in the location that they're selecting

Once the user selects their starting location, they then move on to their final destination; from there they follow the same steps per the starting location, as the input field again will auto-fill to provide the user their final destination

Once the user completes both sections, the form will auto-populate and the following results will be given to the user:
Latitude, Longitude, Distance to final destination, and Time of Arrival

This is great because the user will receive a wealth of information that is tailored toward their trip. Within this section, we access the Datejs library which gives us the opportunity to calculate current time in a format that is consumable to the Eventful api. These input sections will allow the user to know how many miles they are from their final destination and also what time they will arrive, which is Amazing!!!

From there, the app leads the user to hit the 'Submit' button and from there is where the Eventful api is called. The page then loads 10 results of the events ranked by popularity that are happening at your arrival destination. The events will list where they are, who the artist is, what time they are playing and give you an image(if available) and a link to the event page

We end with our team name and logos from any api's that requested their logo be displayed if we used their services
